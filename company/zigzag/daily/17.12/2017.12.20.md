1. [Github - Pull Request merges](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/)
	- Merge
		- <img src="../img/github/pr - merge.png" width="900" height="400">
		- When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit.
	- Squash and Merge
		- <img src="../img/github/pr - squash.png" width="900" height="400">
		- When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch.
	- Rebase
		- When you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit.

2. [Mithril JS](https://mithril.js.org/index.html)
	- CVnode 와 Vnode 차이는 무엇인가?
		```javascript
		/** Virtual DOM nodes, or vnodes, are Javascript objects that represent an element (or parts of the DOM). */
		interface Vnode<Attrs = {}, State extends Lifecycle<Attrs, State> = Lifecycle<Attrs, State>> {
			/** The nodeName of a DOM element. It may also be the string [ if a vnode is a fragment, # if it's a text vnode, or < if it's a trusted HTML vnode. Additionally, it may be a component. */
			tag: string | ComponentTypes<Attrs, State>;
			/** A hashmap of DOM attributes, events, properties and lifecycle methods. */
			attrs: Attrs;
			/** An object that is persisted between redraws. In component vnodes, state is a shallow clone of the component object. */
			state: State;
			/** The value used to map a DOM element to its respective item in an array of data. */
			key?: string | number;
			/** In most vnode types, the children property is an array of vnodes. For text and trusted HTML vnodes, The children property is either a string, a number or a boolean. */
			children?: ChildArrayOrPrimitive;
			/**
			 * This is used instead of children if a vnode contains a text node as its only child.
			 * This is done for performance reasons.
			 * Component vnodes never use the text property even if they have a text node as their only child.
			 */
			text?: string | number | boolean;
		}

		interface CVnode<A = {}> extends Vnode<A, ClassComponent<A>> { }

		/**
		 * Components are a mechanism to encapsulate parts of a view to make code easier to organize and/or reuse.
		 * Any class that implements a view method can be used as a Mithril component.
		 * Components can be consumed via the m() utility.
		 */
		interface ClassComponent<A = {}> extends Lifecycle<A, ClassComponent<A>> {
			/** The oninit hook is called before a vnode is touched by the virtual DOM engine. */
			oninit?(vnode: Vnode<A, this>): any;
			/** The oncreate hook is called after a DOM element is created and attached to the document. */
			oncreate?(vnode: VnodeDOM<A, this>): any;
			/** The onbeforeupdate hook is called before a vnode is diffed in a update. */
			onbeforeremove?(vnode: VnodeDOM<A, this>): Promise<any> | void;
			/** The onupdate hook is called after a DOM element is updated, while attached to the document. */
			onremove?(vnode: VnodeDOM<A, this>): any;
			/** The onbeforeremove hook is called before a DOM element is detached from the document. If a Promise is returned, Mithril only detaches the DOM element after the promise completes. */
			onbeforeupdate?(vnode: Vnode<A, this>, old: VnodeDOM<A, this>): boolean | void;
			/** The onremove hook is called before a DOM element is removed from the document. */
			onupdate?(vnode: VnodeDOM<A, this>): any;
			/** Creates a view out of virtual elements. */
			view(vnode: Vnode<A, this>): Children | null | void;
		}

		1. ClassComponent를 포함하는지 여부 차이
		2. CVnode 는 Vnode를 상속받아 구현하였으며, State 값에 Attrs를 ClassComponent에 포함하여 추상화 하였습니다.
